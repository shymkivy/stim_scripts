mouse_4_23_19

day 1 lick reward script

purpose is to train the mouse to lick from port and associate the tone with the reward

40.5ml start.

20ms sol
2000ms delay
tone during reward

started to lick right away

at 300 sec made duration 5000 to make it harder

end ~39.8ml

-----------day 2
54.2ml start

running full vmmn with sound during the reward trial, so he learns to associate
delay is 1000

black screen, will change to gray

20ms reward

didn't save orientation data from vmmn script by accident

take off at 680 sec in pt 2

-----------day 3

made sol 30, seems too much.took him off at 1700

at 1500 was not licking, so I moved it closer, started licking again

--------day 4

fill water to 40 and take sol back down to 22
start at 33.9mL

first 100 sec was lost because lick did not record. restarted

started part 2 and no licking so stopped..also 1mL was gone.. 22ms seems perfect


-------day 5

47.8ml start
22ms sol

saved only 2000, so continued in part 2

otherwise great, looks like he has learned``   


-----------day 6 

sound off
51.7ml start
22ms sol

looks good at start

----day 7 

45.7ml start
22ms sol                
started at 7, 3 hrs earlier than normal  


---day8
first day ran on microscope

was 2 hrs late and was not good performance

----------day9
 imaging 

set up port position in beginning, maybe good after 120 sec     

only 2000 recorded..... fuck. he stocped drinking anyway after second run
